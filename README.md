# PROJECT-1-TETRIS-UNITTESTING-AIRobot
This project is about how to build a world famous game, Tetris, with java in javaswing. After building up the .jar file, I decided to test my Tetris automatically. Therefore, I wrote a unit testing code with JUnit. Also, I have another idea: what if an AI robot could play with my Tetris? How interesting is that!

### Source Code of Tetris (code in Java Swing)
(1) Tetris: main function
(2) Board: to set the board and all movements and actions
(3) Shape: to set all kinds of shapes

### Unit Testing of Testris (code with JUnit)
(1) Tetris.test: to test movements and the function of game-over

### Training AI Robot to be A Player (code in Python)
