# TETRIS-UNITTESTING-AIRobot
This project is about how to build a world famous game, Tetris, with java by javaswing. After building up the .jar file, I decided to test my Tetris automatically. Therefore, I wrote a unit testing code with JUnit. Also, I have another idea: what if an AI robot could play with my Tetris? How interesting is that!
